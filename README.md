# hello-world
It is a place that stores my ideas and resources for this project
Hi everyone,
I'm Ke, a PR and marketing practitioner. I'm passionate about music/entertainment/media industries and have worked on campaigns for vairous music festivals and live events. I don't have any background of coding but I will try my best to digest what we learn in this course and get my own project done!
